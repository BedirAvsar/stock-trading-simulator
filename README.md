## 🧠 How It Works (Backend Flow)

1. User logs in → session created  
2. User searches stock quote → API request  
3. Buy/sell operation validated  
4. SQLite updates:
   - cash balance  
   - shares table  
   - transaction logs  
5. Portfolio recalculates live market value  
6. History stores all actions

## 💡 What I Learned

This project strengthened several key backend skills:

- Flask routing, sessions, templates  
- SQL queries and database schema design  
- JSON parsing and API integration  
- Error handling & edge case management  
- Authentication logic and stateful design  
- Debugging request flow and logic consistency

## 📄 Note
This project is based on Harvard CS50x Week 9 but includes custom improvements and refactoring.
